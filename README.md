## Project Description

I went through a lot of Vue.js documentation but never got into it deeply, and coincidentally started learning it. Having experience in React and jQuery, grasping the concepts of Vue.js was super fun. The syntax and structure of the application were really simple. As a backend guy, I found Vue.js to be a simple, portable, and hence powerful framework for front-end development.

While working on a project that involved CRUD and authentication APIs, I learned a lot of things, from passing props to passing parameters, to reducing API calls, using router and binding values, and integrating npm packages.

The most significant learning is that Vue.js is handy if it is being used in legacy code, especially if the product was developed a decade ago, due to its portability such as through the CDN
